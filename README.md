# Project Name - Artsy With Anshu

I've made an art website in which I have included 5 html files :
1. artpage.html file : It is the file that directs the user to the home of my webpage.
2. bio.html file : In this file I have mentioned about some forms of arts.
3. artists.html file :  In this file I have mentioned about some famous artists codes.In this file I've used Bootstrap grid layout.
4. contacts.html file: In this file I have included details of me. In this file I have used the media query so that screen becomes responsive.
5. works.html file: In this file I have included some of my own works.

I've used NAVBAR component of Bootstrap in all my html files.
All my webpages are responsive.
